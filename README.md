## Analysis of the Superconductor Dataset

The analysis of the relationship between the critical temperature and the physical properties of superconductors is done on the Superconductor dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/superconductivty+data). 

The goal of this analysis is to find out the attributes or physical properties that correlate most with the critical temperature of superconductors. With those findings, machine learning models are fit to try to predict the critical temperature of superconductors.

In summary, the following procedures are carried out in this analysis: <br>
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Finding out the best associations of variables using correlation coefficients and Shannon's entropy.
* Fitting machine learning models on the supeconductor data set.
